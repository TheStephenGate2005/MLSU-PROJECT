# Furuniverse

The **Furuniverse** is a fully fictional, in-universe multiversal setting created as a long-term worldbuilding and documentation project.

This repository serves as an **archive and reference collection**, containing structured notes, images, and documents that describe the Furuniverse, its dimensions, planetary systems, species categories, and internal rules.

The Furuniverse is not based on real-world people, events, history, or organizations. It exists entirely within its own fictional framework.

## Overview

In the Furuniverse, reality operates differently than in our world.

- Wildlife and everyday objects exist, but are often **somewhat limited or subtly presented**, depending on the dimension.
- Dimensions are **structured and regulated**, not chaotic or empty.
- Existence continues through transformation, continuity, and long timelines rather than abrupt endings.
- Many beings experience **extended lifespans**, often exceeding those typical of our reality.

The Furuniverse is considered **endless in scope**, but internally organized.

## Repository Purpose

This repository exists to:
- Preserve Furuniverse materials in a stable format
- Provide reference documentation for creative use
- Allow passive discovery and long-term archiving
- Enable others to reference or build upon the material if desired

Development is slow, intentional, and may remain static for long periods.
